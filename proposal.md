# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Unmatched 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A discord bot that will let you find the love of yourself that is actually the complete opposite of you. "opposites attract" quite literally

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our software will be a discord bot that completly randomizes you with a stranger with someone who has the complete opposite interests as you. It'll have the feature to set up your profile similar to how you would on dating apps and match with different people. However, the catch here is that it'll only let you match with people that are the complete opposite of you, hence the motto "opposites attract". To execute this, we would first create a discord bot similar to how we set up any bot, then we would program the bot to ask you a series of questions about yourself. Once we do that, we will then create a program where it'll match you with users across different servers that have the opposite taste as you. You would give the bot commands as to what you want and it will find the complete opposite for you. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Kuralai Zholdosh (TA: Sai Shi, email: kuralai.zholdosh.kyzy@temple.edu)
Alex Thomer (TA: Sai Shi, email: alex.thomer@temple.edu)

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be the bot to have some working functionalities to it such as getting you're profile set up and allowing you to view other discord users. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We probably can get the discord bot set up at least with it making your profile and showing you potential options once you invite it into the server. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
A best outcome for this project would be for this program to actually work without any errors. The possibility of getting it to completely match you with someone without any errors before the deadline would be really great.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The skills we would need to acquire is at least for me personally finding out how I want to get it to randomize your matches based off of what you put in. Someone would probably start with setting up the program on prompts to ask you on a general idea about you such as interests and etc. The other two classmates would probably work to figure out how to set it up to randomize the program with people and get you to match with someone.
